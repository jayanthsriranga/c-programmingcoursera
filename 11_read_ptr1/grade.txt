Grading at Wed Jun 24 12:13:37 UTC 2020
Attempting to compile test.c
gcc -o test -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu99 test.c
compiled
I expected to find a file called 'answer.txt' but it did not exist
(or was not a regular file)
Here are the files that I can find:
answers.txt
Makefile
README
test
test.c
Your output did not match what we expected.

Overall Grade: FAILED
